# Developing a Shell using C/C++

This project contains a shell developed in Operational Systems subject in University of Brasilia. The goal in this project was make a shell with Brazilian Portuguese commands making any necessary system call.

> Compiling and executing

```sh
make
```

And execute the next command to execute the game:

```sh
./unbshrc
```

When executing, the first line prompted will show the PATH of the shell developed. This variable can be configured in the .unbshrc_profile file. The shell uses aliases for the UNIX commands, and, in order to edit those aliases, the .unbshrc file may be edited.

> Test Environment

This project was compiled using g++ (Ubuntu 7.5.0-3ubuntu1~18.04) 7.5.0, then it may not work with previous g++ versions.
